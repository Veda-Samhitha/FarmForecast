# FarmForecast
Developed a *crop and fruit price prediction tool* designed to assist farmers in making informed financial decisions. This tool was built using MERN to create a website for farmers to access and we have used  XGBoost, Scikit-learn, and NumPy. Its purpose was to forecast future prices based on available data, helping farmers better plan their sales and reduce financial uncertainty.

The system leveraged *historical and seasonal agricultural data* to provide accurate predictions. By analyzing trends and patterns, it enabled smarter decisions in crop selection, irrigation scheduling, and market timing. This allowed farmers to strategize more effectively, improving the overall planning of their agricultural operations.

The tool ultimately contributed to *enhanced farming efficiency* by delivering simple, accessible market insights. It helped boost productivity, reduce losses, and support sustainable agriculture practices. By using this solution, farmers were empowered with real-time knowledge that guided both short-term actions and long-termÂ planning.
